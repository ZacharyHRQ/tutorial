# Next.js Concepts

This section demonstrates core Next.js concepts using minimal, runnable examples.

## Routing & Layouts

- Example: A main routing page and a nested route.

## Client & Server Components
- Next.js allows you to use both client and server components.
- Example: A server component that renders a client component.

## API Routes
- Next.js allows you to create API routes within your application.
