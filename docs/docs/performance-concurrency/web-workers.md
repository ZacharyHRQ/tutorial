# Web Workers

Web Workers are a powerful feature that allows you to run JavaScript code in a separate thread, keeping your main UI thread responsive. This is particularly useful for CPU-intensive tasks that might otherwise block the main thread and cause the UI to become unresponsive.

## Key Concepts

1. **Main Thread vs Worker Thread**
   - Main thread: Handles UI updates and user interactions
   - Worker thread: Runs CPU-intensive tasks without blocking the main thread

2. **Communication**
   - Workers communicate with the main thread using `postMessage`
   - Data is copied between threads (structured cloning)
   - No direct access to DOM or window object in workers

3. **Types of Workers**
   - Dedicated Workers: One-to-one relationship with the main thread
   - Shared Workers: Can be accessed by multiple scripts
   - Service Workers: For offline capabilities and push notifications

## Example Implementation

```typescript
// Creating a worker
const worker = new Worker('worker.js');

// Sending data to worker
worker.postMessage({ type: 'PROCESS_DATA', data: someData });

// Receiving data from worker
worker.onmessage = (event) => {
  const result = event.data;
  // Handle the result
};

// Error handling
worker.onerror = (error) => {
  console.error('Worker error:', error);
};
```

## When to Use Web Workers

- CPU-intensive calculations
- Large data processing
- Real-time data analysis
- Image processing
- Complex algorithms

## Best Practices

1. **Worker Management**
   - Create workers when needed
   - Terminate workers when no longer needed
   - Reuse workers for similar tasks

2. **Data Transfer**
   - Minimize data transfer between threads
   - Use transferable objects when possible
   - Consider data serialization overhead

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Gracefully handle worker termination
   - Provide fallback mechanisms

4. **Resource Management**
   - Monitor worker memory usage
   - Clean up resources properly
   - Handle worker lifecycle events

## Limitations

- No direct DOM access
- Limited access to browser APIs
- Data transfer overhead
- Browser compatibility considerations
